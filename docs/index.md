# SiteMarker Docs

## The Documentation is still incomplete

## About

SiteMarker is an open-source bookmark manager. The main aim behind the project is to make managing bookmarks as simple as typing them.

## Version Info

SiteMarker comes in 2 different version schemes:

### The stable version

Sitemarker has undergone a major rewrite from ground up. While the rewrite has been completed, it is not yet stable. So until it is determined to be usable for anyone, Sitemarker will be available only to the flatpak users of Linux distributions.

See [Installation Guide](./installation_guide.md#stable-version) to install it.

Current stable version: 1.2.3

### The development version

This version is always in development and is not installable via stable channels like [Flathub](https://https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.aerocyber.sitemarker), [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/osmata), package managers, APKs or Windows Installers. You must follow the [Build Instructions in the Installation Guide](./installation_guide.md#Development Version) to install it. Or, get it from the development/beta builds from [Github releases](https://github.com/aerocyber/sitemarker/releases).

This version may be the next minor release OR the next major release.
