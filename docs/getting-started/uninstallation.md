# Uninstallation Guide

It is sad to see a user go but we acknowledge your choice. Uninstalling Sitemarker depends on:

- where you installed it - Android/Linux/Windows
- how you installed it

## Windows

### Installed
To uninstall from Windows, look for an entry in Settings > Apps and uninstall from there. A copy of the uninstaller will also be present in the installation folder as `unins000.exe`

### Not Installed
If you have not installed Sitemarker on Windows, that is you downloaded the zip file and extracted it, simply delete the extracted folder.

## Android

To uninstall from Android, long press the launcher icon, tap App Info and then tap Uninstall. This process generally depends on the version of Android, your OEM and the launcher you use.

Alternatively, use the app store management client you used.

## Linux

```bash
sudo snap remove sitemarker
```
